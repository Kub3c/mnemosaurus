# Mnemosaurus

Mnemosaurus is a web portal designed to help anyone learn a language using mnemonics. When the product will be ready, any registered user will be able to add, read and rate mnemonics added by the other users. For now, the app is only in development mode, but later we would like to make it accessible online.

The app is built using Laravel 7 and Vue.js components.
